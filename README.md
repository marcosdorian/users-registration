# users-registration
My studies in Django and SQL Lite for creating a web application to register and show users.

TO START THE PROJECT:
1. You must create the migration for the database:
  python3 manage.py makemigration
2. You must run migration:
   python3 manage.py migrate
3. Then you can run the application:
   python3 manage.py runserver
